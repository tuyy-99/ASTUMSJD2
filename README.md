# Kawaii TodoList

Welcome to Kawaii TodoList, a fun and adorable to-do list app I whipped up to help keep track of daily tasks with a cute twist! Inspired by kawaii aesthetics, this project features a pastel pink background, a lovable bunny graphic, and a simple interface where you can add, check off, or delete tasks. I wanted to create something both functional and visually pleasing, so I leaned into a soft color palette and playful design elements to make task management feel a bit more joyful. It’s built using basic HTML and CSS, making it easy to run right in your browser without any fancy setup.

The app lets you input tasks via a text field and manage them with a checkmark to mark as done or an "X" to remove them. I’ve included a little "Tasks added successfully!" message to give some positive feedback. The project was a fun challenge, and I’ve added screenshots below to show off the final look. Whether you’re planning a trip to the market or learning a new skill, this little tool can help you stay organized in style!

** Development Experience
Building this was a mix of easy wins and some tricky moments. The easy part was setting up the HTML structure and styling with CSS—once I had the layout down, adding the kawaii theme with pastel colors and the bunny image was a breeze. I used flexbox to align the task items and added hover effects for a bit of interactivity, which felt straightforward. The difficult part came with ensuring the task list updated smoothly and the buttons worked as expected—I had to double-check my CSS selectors and tweak the positioning to avoid overlap. I approached it by breaking the task into small steps: first the static design, then the dynamic elements, testing as I went. Overall, it was a rewarding process, and I learned a lot about balancing aesthetics with functionality!
